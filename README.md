# Background location app

This app was made with demonstration purposes.
The main feature is to fetch the user's location periodically and save it locally for displaying a log. <br>
Libraries used: **Realm** for local database handling and **Dexter** for permission request.
The app has some features like ***pull to refresh*** and ***swipe for delete*** for some user interaction.<br>
The location fetching process is made by using  a ***broadcast receiver***
